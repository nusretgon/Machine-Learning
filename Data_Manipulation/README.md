# **If we need to manipulate datasets, we need these code blocks.**
### Missing Values
* I recently upload new file missingValueCheck.py. If we want to check any missing value. We can use isnull() function.

* First of all, I will show how to deal with missing values.
* In missingValues.py  we will change missing values with mean of datas.
* Results are ;

### Categorical Values
* We should cast categoric values to numeric because we can't use in calculation categoric values.
* All steps shown in picture ;

* After first project, we get 0 1 2 for country. But we can't say US better than TR or FR.
* So we did second process.

### We rarely use scaling process.
* We have lots of data and we want these datas similar.
* So we can use scaling process.

### Dummy Variable

* Sometimes we have more than one variable to represent one feature. For example,sex.
* In dummyVariable.py firstly we cast sex column to numeric values. Then we get Mens and Womens.
* Men mean not women. Women mean not men. So we don't need any second column.
* If we use just men column, we solve problem.
